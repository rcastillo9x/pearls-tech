# What is the importance of data visualization?

Data visualization is important because it allows you to deeply understand trends, values, or patterns of data represented through graphical representation of information.

Suppose you have the data and know how to perform statistical analysis like standard deviation or correlation, but this doesn't give the entirety of the data. For example, by visualizing them graphically, using a dataset like Datasaurus, you can see different representations despite having the same information.

It Enables Discoveries in Our Data

Data visualization allows you to find findings directly and very simply, such as:

    Identifying trends
    Observing behaviors
    Detecting Outliers

It Provides Greater Clarity in the Code

It is also used in data science oriented towards machine learning or artificial intelligence, like training lines. This is part of the training of any algorithm because you will always be analyzing this, and the easiest way to understand it is through visualizations.
Libraries for Data Visualization

In data visualization, you will find two very important libraries to start with:
Matplotlib

    Emulates Matlab commands
    Uses Numpy
    Written in Python
    Very simple to write
    Fast
    Customizable

Seaborn

    A library built on top of Matplotlib

Uses case
